# Welcome to SSUMobile

This is the repository for the official iOS App for Sonoma State University.

This has been worked on by many students over several years.
Unfortunately, we had some private debugging-related code in the repository that could
not be open sourced, so the repo history was not kept in tact. We have it available if
there is certain need for it.

## Setup

First, clone the repo with git:

    git clone https://github.com/SSU-CS-Department/ssumobile-ios
    cd ssumobile-ios
    

Then, the CocoaPods dependency manager needs to be run to pull in dependencies.
If you do not have it installed already, see [here](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation) for installation instructions

    pod install
    open SSUMobile.xcworkspace
